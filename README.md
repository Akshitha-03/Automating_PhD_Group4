<p allign="justify">
The new generation of college applicants has practically grown up on the internet. They are used to accessing anything they want instantly, at the click of a button. Automated application software will help your team answer all their queries instantly, send automated updates to them and help them navigate through the whole application process through a clean and modern interface. Our project provides a software solution to automate the PhD admission processes at research organizations / educational institutes. It provides a central place for all admission related data and it serves as a collaboration platform for all relevant stakeholders. The end result from this software is where best and eligible students for pursuing PhD are selected and called in for an interview. </p>
